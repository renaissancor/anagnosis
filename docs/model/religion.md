# Religion in Anagnosis

## Role of Religion

Religion in this framework is **not** a cultural descriptor — it is a **civilizational boundary**.

The same ethnic group under different religions produces different polities with different valid successors. This is not a subtle distinction. It is the primary reason why:
- A Serb, a Croat, and a Bosniak are linguistically and genetically near-identical, yet belong to different civilizational spheres (Orthodox/Byzantine, Catholic/Habsburg, Muslim/Ottoman)
- A Hindu Punjabi, a Muslim Punjabi, and a Sikh Punjabi are the same people with the same language, yet produced completely different political identities
- Urdu and Hindi are the same spoken language — mutually intelligible — yet represent distinct civilizational identities purely through script and religious vocabulary

## Religion as Polity Identity

Religion is part of a polity's fixed **ideology** (see `ideology.md`). It does not change mid-polity without marking the end of that polity.

### The Zoroastrian/Islamic Break in Persia

This is the clearest example. The transition from Sassanid to Abbasid rule on the Iranian plateau is:
- Type C in territorial terms (same land)
- But also an **ideological rupture** — Zoroastrianism to Sunni Islam

Then the Safavid revolution (1501) introduced a *second* rupture on the same land:
- Same Persian ethnicity as pre-Islamic Persia (Type A ethnic)
- Same Iranian territory (Type A territorial)
- But Shia Islam vs Sunni Islam — a **civilizational wall** between Safavid Iran and its Sunni Timurid predecessors

This is why modern Iran is not simply "Persian." It is specifically **Shia Persian** — and that distinction is the foundation of its entire geopolitical identity vis-à-vis Sunni Arab/Turkic neighbors.

## The Religion Tree

Religions are organized as a tree (see `religions.json`), where:
- Distance between two religions on the tree = ideological distance
- Same leaf node = strong continuity
- Same branch (e.g., both Sunni) = moderate continuity
- Different top-level family (e.g., Zoroastrian vs Islamic) = rupture

## Unique / Anomalous Cases

**Uyghur Khaganate — Manichaeism**
One of the only states in history to officially adopt Manichaeism. A syncretic religion blending Zoroastrian, Christian, and Buddhist elements. Represents a sharp ideological break from the Göktürk Tengriism that preceded it.

**Khazar Khaganate — Judaism**
The ruling class of the Khazar Khaganate converted to Rabbinic Judaism. Possibly a deliberate diplomatic neutrality — positioned between Christian Byzantium to the west and Muslim Caliphate to the south. A Turkic nomadic state with a Semitic religion creates a unique civilizational identity.

**Yuan Dynasty — Vajrayana Buddhism**
Kublai Khan adopted Tibetan Buddhism and appointed the Phags-pa Lama as the imperial preceptor. This served multiple functions: spiritual, and as legitimization over both Tibetan and Mongol subjects. Qing dynasty later did the same.

**Roman Empire — Mid-Dynasty Conversion**
Constantine's conversion (312) began as policy; Theodosius I's edict (380) made Christianity the only legal religion. This is the rare case where a **policy became an ideology mid-polity** — but it is better modeled as the Roman Empire being an ideological predecessor to the Byzantine Empire, rather than the same polity with a changed ideology.

## Religion and Succession Logic

When evaluating succession type, religion acts as a modifier:

| Scenario | Base Type | Religion Modifier |
|---|---|---|
| Same ethnicity, same territory, same religion | A | None — clean Orthodox succession |
| Same ethnicity, same territory, different religion | Would be A | Degrades to near-C; the ideological rupture is significant |
| Different ethnicity, same territory, same religion | C | Softened — shared religion creates civilizational continuity |
| Different ethnicity, different territory, same religion | D | Possibly upgraded — religious kinship can justify succession claims |

Example: The Crusader States (Catholic Latin rulers in the Levant) have:
- Different ethnicity from Byzantium (Latin vs Greek)
- Overlapping territory (Levant)
- Different religion (Catholic vs Orthodox)
→ They are **not** legitimate successors to Byzantine rule in the Levant, despite sharing Christian faith — the Orthodox/Catholic split is a civilizational boundary, not a mere doctrinal difference.
